## Tedium!

A helpful bot for doing mass changes to Polymer team's github repos.

## Requirements:

### Node 4:

Tedium is written in ES2015, so it only really works in node >v4

```
nvm install v4`
```

### Github token

You need to create a github token and place it in a file named `token`.
The token only needs the 'public repos' permission.

Generate a token here:   https://github.com/settings/tokens
